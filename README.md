## Use case

Whenever I walk to my closet to change, I'd have to walk back to my desk and unlock my phone to check the temperature and weather. To avoid this step, I created this always on weather display so I can see the temperature and weather without having to unlock my phone.

## How it works

It calls my API, which takes data from OpenWeather API and digests it down to a simple 4 line json, which is then displayed by the arduino (esp8266) inside the weather display. This simplifies the json manipulation that I had to write in C.
